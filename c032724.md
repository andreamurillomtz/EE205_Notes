---
* **Abstract**: Hide details about how a class does its thing
* **Modularity**: Write code that does one thing well
* **Encapsulation**: Walls around its implementation, so that other programs can't damage its integrity
* **Separation**: Modules are responsible for a set of features

## Abstract Operations
* Characterized by operations
    - Add or subtract a number
    - Concatenate a string
    - Negate or OR a boolean

* **Mutable**: Able to mutate (change)
* **Immutable**: Not able to mutate (change)

## Taxonomy of Operations
* **Creators**: Create new objects of a certain type 
* **Producers**: Create new objects from old objects of the same type
* **Observers**: Take objects of abstract type and return objects of different type (usually immutable)
    - Getters
* **Mutators**: Change objects
    - Setters

## Abstract Interfaces
Its a contract which they do what they say they will do

* Container
* Sequence Containers
* Reversible Containers
* Contiguous Containers: The items next to each other are physically next to each other

### Container
```
C<type> // Stores objects of type inside - Template interface
a.size()
begin() // Returns an iterator starting int he frist element
end()   // Returns an iterator starting at the last element
a.swap(b)  // Swaps objects a and b inside the container
```

* **array**: Container, ContiguousContainer, ReversibleContainer
* **list**: Container, SequenceContainer, ReversibleContainer
