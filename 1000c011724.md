C programs are compiled from soucre code. 
They'ree usually named: 
	- filename.c
	- fileheader.h

## Compilation steps:
* Precompilation: define, #include, ifdef, etc
* Compilation: Convert Source Code to Assembly Language
* Assembly: Convert Assembly into Machine Language saved in an Object File (filename.o)
* Linking: Combines object files together into an Executable Program

OS will load the program into the memory:
* Loading program into memory
* Look for libraries and finding libraries on the filesystem and load them into memory as well
* Binding external "symbols" between program and libraries
* Call main()
* Schedule the program for execution


## Source Code

All C statements end in the semi-colon (;)
Unless you're enclosed in quotes. C does't care about white spaces
C doesn't have a native string datatype, but instead it has a null terminated character array:
'''
char name [8] = "Mark" ;
'''
it would be: 4D 61 72 6B 00 (00 is the null terminated character)
ASCII table is a table that matches symbols to bytes

* [ASCII Table](https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/references/ascii-table)

```
	include <stdio.h>
	int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
		printf( "argc = %d \n", argc);
		for( int i = 0; i < argc ; i++) {
			printf( "argv[%d] = \"%s\ \n", i, argv[i] );
		}
	return 0;
	};
```

## Functions and Variables
C programs consist of function and variables

Function:
```
    >>> float celsiusToFahrenheit( float inCelsius ) {
    >>>     float outFahrenheit = inCelsius * 1.8 + 32;
    >>> return 0;
    >>> }
```
All variables and functions must be <u>declared</u> before referenced in code
All variables and functions must be <u>defined</u> before a program can use them
A function is a set of statements:
* A statement can be one thing
* Or a group of things, surrounded by {}

## Naming Convensions
Can be named whatever
Case sensitive: myclass != MYCLASS
Must start with a non-digit character
Can't be a keyword
