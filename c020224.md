## Parameters
* Functions may accept zero or more parameters, initialized from arguments when the function gets called
* Parameters are inside the function
* Functions get **invoked** by naming the function, putting the arguments in parentheses and catching the return value

## No Parameters
* Functions may accept zero parameters and don't return anything
* Use void to return nothing
* Main by default has 4 parameters at least

## Return Values
* Functions may return one **expression** (stuff on the right to the = )
* Functions may return other native datatypes (but not compound datatypes)
* Can never return big things (arrays, compound objects, classes...)

## External Functions
* **External Functions**: Functions you didn't write yourself
     - *Standard Library*: printf(), exit(), atoi()
     - *Nonstandard Libraries*: math, curses, ML, etc.
     - Libraries contain the definition (executable code) of functions
     - *Header Files (**.h**)*: contain the declarations of the functions (how they are used)
     - The linker and loader works together to find external functions and bind them to the  executable

## Stubbing out code
Figure out the files you need and create them

```
$ touchs log.c log.h wc.c wc.h
```

Start creating function prototypes in the **.h** files:

```
extern void logInfo( char message[] );
extern void logWarning( char message[] );
extern void logFatal( cahr message[] );
```

**Stub**: write the empty function in a **.c** file
```
coid logInfor( cahr message[]) ) { }

## Variables
* Hold data

Things to keep track of:
* **Lifetime**: Has memory reserved or released data?
* **Initialization**: Has the memory been set or is it initialized?
* **Visibility or Scope**: Do other functions have access to the symbol that points to the memory

3 Types of Variables:
* **Local Variables**: Declared inside the blocks 
* **Global Variables**: Declared outside of blocks (usually at the top of the progam)
* **Parameters**: Passes from one block to another (similary to local variables)

Modifiers:
* **External**: Variables extend the visibility of a variable to outside of its normal
* **Static**: Variables stay allocated in the memory even after the function ends
* **Const**: Variables are constant and can't be changes
