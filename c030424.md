## Polymorphism
* Many forms
* Allows an object to behave different in different conditions
* Occurs when classes are related to each other by inheritance

### **Virtual** is a keyword in C++
* Found at runtime not compile time (bound at runtime not compile)
* Make polymorphism work
* Defines in  base classes and overridden in derived classes

## Types of Functions
* **Functions**: Regular functions. Inside classes are methods
* **Virtual Functions**: Dynamically bound functions. Declared virtual in the base class it allows regular functions in derived classes to be bound at runtime
* **Pure Virtual Functions**: Empty shell of a function. Declaration but no definition. Can not be instantiated
* **Final Functions**: Can not be overridden ( final void sayHi() {cout << "Hello";} )
* **Static Functions**: Restricted to the file where they're declared ( static testCat() {...private...;} )

## Abstract Classes
Separate an Implementation from a declaration
* **Abstract Classes** : OO Interfaces(small set of operation)
* Can not be instantiated
* Used to declare a common set of methods for various implementations
* Intended to be inherit by concrete classes

```
class Itereator { // Forward
public:
    virtual bool hasNext() = 0;
    virtual void* next()   = 0;
};
```

## Type of Classes
* **Base Classes**: Parent classes. Sometimes can be instantiated.
* **Derived Classes**: Falls under Base Class
* **Concrete Classes**: Can be instantiated (dog,cats,etc)
* **Abstract Classes**: Separate implementation from declaration 
* **Static Classes**: 
    * C Static Variables inside a function stay alive even when function is not being used. Only initializes once
    * c++ Static Members are associated with the class not the objects of the class
