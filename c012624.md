## Process
* **Code**: Think about your editors. Max productivity
* **Build**: Think about your build process. How to compile only what you need
* **Test**: How to test large, complex programs. Use Unit Test
* **Package**: How you deliver the program to your customer? Should you create a setup.exe for it? A .rpm or yum package? 
* **Release**: How do cusotmers get the package?

# C Datatypes
C is a stronglt typed language

* **Weakly typed languages**: easier to write and friendlier to people (JavaScript, Pearl, PHP, Virtual Basic)
* **Strongly typed languages**: More issues at compile-time (C and Java)

## void
* Is a **placeholder** that means this could be anything ot nothing

## int
* Signed by default
* Actual size is *native* to the machine architecture
* Guaranteed to be at least 16 bits (16-bit int goes from -32768 to 32767)

## unsigned Int
* Same as int but only positive numbers (16-bit unsigned int is 0 to 65535)

## short, short int, signed short, and short signed int 
* Are all the same
* Guaranteed to be at least 16-bits and will never be larger than an int

## long, long int, signed long, and signed long int
* Are 64 bits

## bool
* Boolean datatype
* Values of true(not 0) and false(0)

## char
* Native is signed
* 8 bits (1 byte)
