## Sorting Algorithms
* O(n^2): Quadratic
* O(nLog(n)): sorts
* Hybrid Sorts

**Test For**: 
* Two things are the same
* A thing is >< another thing

## Selection Sort
* Iterating through entire list
    - Find smallest element in the list 
    - Swap the smallest element with he outside iterator

## Bubble Sort
* Iterate through list twice
    - Compare each adjoining elements and swap if they're out of order

## Cocktail Shaker Sort
* Iterate through list TWICE (smart)
    - Each time, stopping one step closer from the end


### Stack
LIFO (Last In First Out) structure

## ADT Operations
* void push( value)
* value pop()
* value peek()

If stack pointer (SP) and base pointer (BP) are the same then the stack is empty.

**SP** always points to an empty cell.
