## GNU Make
### $ make
* *make* utility manages programs with many source files
* *make* automatically determines which pieces of a large program need to be compiled
* *make* uses file timestamps to decide when something's changed (compared to git which looks for changes)
* *make* is a configured from a file called **Makefile**

```
hello: g
```

## Makefiles
* Just a text file
* Use hidden <tab> characters
* Is a *directed asylcic graph* or dependencies
* Contain micros, variables, targets...

```
// mailcheck.c depends on mailcheck.h and shell.h
// targets: dependencies
all: bash 

mailcheck.o: mailcheck.c mailcheck.h shell.h
    gcc -c mailcheck.c   // Hidden tab, command to execute

shell.o: shell.c shell.h
    gcc -c shell.c

bash: mailcheck.o shell.o
    gcc -o bash mailcheck.o shell.o
// Rule: targets + dependencies + commands
```

## Macros & variables
* *Make* has a lot of repeating patters..Macros help to write repeatable patters
* Macro definitions are: MACRONAME = some text
    - GCC = gcc
    - OBJECTS  = mailcheck.o shell.o
* Pattern rules can use %
    - %.o: %.c
