## The if statement
```
#include <time.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    long theTime = time( null );
    
    if ( theTime % 2 == 0 );
        printf ( "Time %ld is even\n", theTime );
    } else {
        printf ( "Time %ld is odd\n", theTime );
    }
}
```

## The while loop
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i = 0;
    while( i < 4 ) {
        printf( "i = %d\n", i++ );  // Post-increment, without this loop would run forever
    }
}
```

## The for loop
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i = 0;
    for( int i = 0 ; i < 4 ; i++ ) {
        printf( "i = %d\n", i); 
    }
}
```
```
for( INIT ; CONDITION ; ITERATION );
```

## Magic Numbers:
* Always UPPER case

## Arrays
* Used when you have a collection of related things
* <ins>Array</ins>: a collection of elements, individually accessed by an index (or key)
* Can have array of arrays:
```
int allRents[][];
```

## Logical AND
* Comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=) return 1 when TRUE and 0 when not
* C doesn't have a "AND" keyword, so it uses "&&"
```
if( var1 == 1 && var2 == 1 ) // 1 (TRUE)
```

## Logical OR
* C doesn't have an "OR" keyword, so it uses "||"
```
if( C == 1 || C++ == 1 ) // 1 (TRUE)
```

## Bitwise operators
* & (and) and | (or)
* Does operation for each bit

## C++
* C++ is not an "Objected Oriented"
* They took C and extended it
* It <ins>supports</ins> object oriented programming, procedural programming, generic (Lambda) programming, compile-time(or Template) programming 

## Dev Ops
* Do not hand test but write <ins>Unit Test</ins>
* Forward engineering in industy

## Forward Engineering
* Process of creating an executable
* Mechanics of editing, compiling, linking and testing code
