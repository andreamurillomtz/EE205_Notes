Understand memory allocation

Each address stores 1 Byte (0-255)

Memory is an ocean of addresses starting at 0x00000000

When you store a value in memory then you can retrieve it later

Convension of how you allocate several bytes to store data are "Data Types"

* Procedural programming focus on the order of execution. Data is stored in "structs"
* Object Oriented programming focuses on manipulating objects. Objects manage their own memory. Data is grouped intro classes called "members". Functions stat act on classes are "methods".
