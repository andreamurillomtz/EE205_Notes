## Fractional Numbers
32  16  8  4  2  1  . 1/2  1/4  1/8  1/16  1/32 

## Type Casting
* Programmers can change a datatype "on the fly" using type casting ( int -> float )
```
int two 2;
float four = (float) two * two
```
## Floating Point Numbers
* Float (floating point number): approximation of a fraction
* 3 Parts: 
    - Sign
    - Exponent
    - Mantissa
* Double and long double
* Single precision: 32 bits (sign 1 bit, exponent 8 bits, mantissa 23 bits)
* Double precision: 64 bits

* **Hyper-threading**: Having multiple threads(processes) in 1 core

## #define for Integer Constants
* Precompiler does string substitution on #define
* Can add const to make it a constant that can't change
```
// Wrap in paranthesis
#define DAYS_IN_WEEK      (7)
#define HOURS_IN_DAY      (24)
#define MINUTES_IN_HOUR   (60)
```
## Allocating Memory
* There's an address for each byte

## Fixed Datatypes
* In addition to **Native** (char,short,int,long)
* *stdint.h* defines several fixed-width datatypes

## Functions
* **Functions**: break large tasks and breaks it into small ones
* Allow people to wrote on others' work, rather than start from scratch
* It's better to have a lots of small functions rather than a few long ones
* *Do one thing really well*
* C programs consist of functions and variables
* All functions and variables must be declared and defined before a program can use them
* A function is a set of statements:

### Naming Conventions
* Are case sensitive (myClass != myCLASS)
* Must start with a non-digit character: one is good, 1one is not
* *_Name* and* _name* are not future proof
* *main()* is a special function that is the **entry point** for your program
* C does not distinguish between **procedures** (don't return anything) and **functions** (does return values)
* Does not support nested functions

### Parameters

* Functions may accept zero or more parameters, which are initialized from arguments when the functions is called
