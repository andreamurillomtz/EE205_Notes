## Time
* Represented as number in seconds since epoch
* **Struct**: breaks out the year, month, days, etc

## Data Structures
* **Native Data Types**: char, short, int, long, long long, float, double
* **Structures**: Suitcase of different things

### Structure
```
struct [name] {
	member1; // ex: char name[MAX_VAT_NAME];
	member2;
	...
} [variable1] [variable2] ...; // Allocating memory
```
* Structures must have a name, variable or both
* Once a struct is declared (or defined) it cant be modified
* Can contain any native datatype or another struct
* *name* of a struct is similar to a typedef
* *variable* si where memory is allocated

### Defining a struct
```
struct point {
	int x;
	int y;
};

struct point aPoint;
```

### Initializing a struct
```
struct point {
	int x;
	int y;
};

struct point aPoint {100, 200};
```

### Accessing a struct

variable_name.member_name // Access structure

```
struct point {
	int x;
	int y;
};

struct point aPoint;

aPoint.x // gives 100
aPoint.x = -314;
aPoint.x // gives -314
```
