## Declarations & Definitions
* Variables and functions need to be **declared** before use
* At link time, all variables that get used must be defined

### Declaration
* Name
* Type
* Initial value (optional)
Tells compiler what to expect
Often found in *.h* header files
Repeated as long as they're identical
*Extern* usually

### Definition
Allocates memory
Tells compiler what to do
Often found in *.c* files and not *.h* files
Can only be made once

## Preprocessor
* *include* files from header files (<> from system) ("" from local directory)
* *define* not a real variable. String substitution
* Macro usually use parenthesis

```
SH(x) x*x
printf("%d\n", SH(3+4) // 3+4*3*4 = 19


SH(x) ((x)*(x))
printf("%d\n", SH(3+4) // ((3+4)*(3+4)) = 49
```

### Preprocessor Keywords
if, elif, else, endif
ifdef ifndef, define undef // if defined
iclude, line (sub the line number), error, pragma (communicate directly to the compiler)

To see the preprocessor in action
```
$ gcc -E source.c
```
