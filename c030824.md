## Properties of Pointers
* Pointing to a memory address
* Size of a memory address

## Declarations
* \* can append to the datatype
* \* can prepend the variable name
```
int* pMonthsOne;
int *pMonthstwo;
```

## Dereferencing Pointers
* **Associated datatype**: Access the object the pointer is pointing to 
```
int months = 12;
int* pMonths = &months;
cout << *pMonths;            // prints 12

int annualPaument = *pMonths * 100;
```

## By Reference Parameters
```
long square( long* a ) {
    *a = *a * *a;
    return *a;
}

main() {
    long a = 4;
    cout << square(&a); // print 16
    cout << a;          // print 16
```

## Advanced Pointers
### Address Arithmetic
```
void* pThis = 0x1000;              
pThis += 5;            // pThis is now 0x1005

int* pThis = 0x1000;   // sizeof(int) == 4
pThis += 5;            // This is now 0x1020
                       // INCREMENTS 5 ints
```
* When you increment a pointer you increment by one associated type

### Memory Allocation
* A pointer definition allocates a read-write <ins>pointer</ins> to a block of read-only memory
