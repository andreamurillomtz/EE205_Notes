## Static Members in C++
* Associated with the Class and not the objects of it
* Independent variables scoped with the class

## Static Functions in C++
* Associated with the Class not the objects of it

## Pointer 
* New syntax 
* **Pointers**: Are variables (make structs,classes,arrays work)
* Dynamic memory allocation
    - *malloc() & free()    new & delete*

### Pointer Properties
* At core it's just an *unsigned integer*
* It is a memory address
* A pointer is the size of a memory address
* A pointer points to another memory address
* Always has the size of an address
    - On a 32-bit machines, there are 4 bytes
    - Ob 64-bit machines, then it depends
    - *sizeof( void* ) will tell you the number of bytes
* When a pointer doesn't point to anything, it is set to NULL (0x00)
* Usually associated with a C datatype

### Pointer Association
* Usually associated wiht a datatype in C
    - char* pUserInput;
    - short* pYear;
* When point doesnt point to anything
    - char* pUserInput = NULL;
* When pointer isn't associated wiht anything
    - Just and address
    - Use **void**: void* pBuffer;

### Address Of
* **&** is one way to populate pointers
```
int index  = 64;
int* pIndex = &index; // &index is the address of index

struct tm myTimeStruct;
struct tm* aPointerToMyTimeStructure = &myTimeStruct; // points to the struct

```
