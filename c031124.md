## Pointers
### C Memory Allocation
**Regions**:
*.data*: Read & Write
*.rodata*: Read Only
*.text*: Machine Code. Read & Execute
*Heap*: Grow down infinetely. 
*Stack*: Grows upward. Local variables when using malloc()

* Arrays: Data is allocated to a read-write memory
* Pointer: Read-only region of memory

### Accessing Members
* **structs**: With a (.)
* **class**: With a (::) & (.)
```
timeStruct.tm_hour;
myCat.speak();
```
* **Pointers**: Use (->) to access members
```
pTimeStruct->tm_hour;      // Structure
pMyCat->speak();           // Class
```

### Casting Pointers
int coordinates[4] = {111, 45, 104, 41};
struct rectangle* pRect = (struct rectangle*) coordinates;
```

### *malloc()*
* Allocate memory in **The Heap** region
```
char* buffer1 = malloc( atoi( argv[1] ));
```

### *malloc* & *free*   *new* & *delete*
**malloc** askes OS to give us more memory
**free** gives memory back to OS
**malloc** can request as much memory as the OS has available

* **new**: Object oriented of malloc
* **delete**: Object oriented of free
