## Call by Value
* C is a call by value
* Make calls by reference using pointers
* Callers and callees need to agree on the number, order and datatype of the parameters

## Global Variables
* Declared and allocated outside of functions
* Available to any function in the .c file
* Convention declared near the top of the .c file
* Can never be duplicated
* Typically get initialized to 0
* **Lifetime**: the life of the process
* **Hungarian Notation**:  Global variables start with a "g"
* Not **static**

## Static Variables
* **Globals** A *static global* can only be used in the same .c program
* **Locals**: A *static local* lifetime is for the life of the process
    - Doesn't evaporate when the function ends
    - Can be reused
    - Initialized the first time but then it just hold the value when function is called again
* Get initialized to 0

## **Const** Variables
*  **const** gives the compiler hints (to optimize the program)
* #define is a preprocessor string substitution


```
#include <stdio.h>
#define SIX 6

const float CONST_SIX = 6;

int main() {
    cahr buffer[6];
    char buffer2[SIX];
    char buffer3[CONST_SIX];  // Will give you an error because it's a float

```
